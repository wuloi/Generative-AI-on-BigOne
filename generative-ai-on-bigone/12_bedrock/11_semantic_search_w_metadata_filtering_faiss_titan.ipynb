      "4 [Document(page_content='Dear shareholders:\\nAs I sit down to write my second annual shareholder letter as CEO, I find myself optimistic and energized\\nby what lies ahead for Amazon. Despite 2022 being one of the harder macroeconomic years in recent memory,and with some of our own operating challenges to boot, we still found a way to grow demand (on top ofthe unprecedented growth we experienced in the first half of the pandemic). We innovated in our largestbusinesses to meaningfully improve customer experience short and long term. And, we made importantadjustments in our investment decisions and the way in which we’ll invent moving forward, while stillpreserving the long-term investments that we believe can change the future of Amazon for customers,\\nshareholders, and employees.\\nWhile there were an unusual number of simultaneous challenges this past year, the reality is that if you\\noperate in large, dynamic, global market segments with many capable and well-funded competitors (theconditions in which Amazon operates all of its businesses), conditions rarely stay stagnant for long.\\nIn the 25 years I’ve been at Amazon, there has been constant change, much of which we’ve initiated ourselves.\\nWhen I joined Amazon in 1997, we had booked $15M in revenue in 1996, were a books-only retailer, didnot have a third-party marketplace, and only shipped to addresses in the US. Today, Amazon sells nearly everyphysical and digital retail item you can imagine, with a vibrant third-party seller ecosystem that accountsfor 60% of our unit sales, and reaches customers in virtually every country around the world. Similarly,building a business around a set of technology infrastructure services in the cloud was not obvious in 2003when we started pursuing AWS, and still wasn’t when we launched our first services in 2006. Having virtuallyevery book at your fingertips in 60 seconds, and then being able to store and retrieve them on a lightweightdigital reader was not “a thing”yet when we launched Kindle in 2007, nor was a voice-driven personal assistantlike Alexa (launched in 2014) that you could use to access entertainment, control your smart home, shop,and retrieve all sorts of information.\\nThere have also been times when macroeconomic conditions or operating inefficiencies have presented us\\nwith new challenges. For instance, in the 2001 dot-com crash, we had to secure letters of credit to buyinventory for the holidays, streamline costs to deliver better profitability for the business, yet still prioritizedthe long-term customer experience and business we were trying to build (if you remember, we actuallylowered prices in most of our categories during that tenuous 2001 period). Y ou saw this sort of balancingagain in 2008-2009 as we endured the recession provoked by the mortgage-backed securities financial crisis.We took several actions to manage the cost structure and efficiency of our Stores business, but we alsobalanced this streamlining with investment in customer experiences that we believed could be substantialfuture businesses with strong returns for shareholders. In 2008, AWS was still a fairly small, fledgling business.We knew we were on to something, but it still required substantial capital investment. There were voicesinside and outside of the company questioning why Amazon (known mostly as an online retailer then) wouldbe investing so much in cloud computing. But, we knew we were inventing something special that couldcreate a lot of value for customers and Amazon in the future. We had a head start on potential competitors;and if anything, we wanted to accelerate our pace of innovation. We made the long-term decision tocontinue investing in AWS. Fifteen years later, AWS is now an $85B annual revenue run rate business, withstrong profitability, that has transformed how customers from start-ups to multinational companies to publicsector organizations manage their technology infrastructure. Amazon would be a different company ifwe’d slowed investment in AWS during that 2008-2009 period.\\nChange is always around the corner. Sometimes, you proactively invite it in, and sometimes it just comes\\na-knocking. But, when you see it’s coming, you have to embrace it. And, the companies that do this well overa long period of time usually succeed. I’m optimistic about our future prospects because I like the way ourteam is responding to the changes we see in front of us.', metadata={'year': 2022, 'source': 'AMZN-2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Over the last several months, we took a deep look across the company, business by business , invention by\\ninvention, and asked ourselves whether we had conviction about each initiative’s long-term potential to driveenough revenue, operating income, free cash flow, and return on invested capital. In some cases, it led to usshuttering certain businesses. For instance, we stopped pursuing physical store concepts like our Bookstoresand 4 Star stores, closed our Amazon Fabric and Amazon Care efforts, and moved on from some newerdevices where we didn’t see a path to meaningful returns. In other cases, we looked at some programs thatweren’t producing the returns we’d hoped (e.g. free shipping for all online grocery orders over $35) andamended them. We also reprioritized where to spend our resources, which ultimately led to the hard decisionto eliminate 27,000 corporate roles. There are a number of other changes that we’ve made over the lastseveral months to streamline our overall costs, and like most leadership teams, we’ll continue to evaluatewhat we’re seeing in our business and proceed adaptively.\\nWe also looked hard at how we were working together as a team and asked our corporate employees to come\\nback to the office at least three days a week , beginning in May. During the pandemic, our employees rallied to\\nget work done from home and did everything possible to keep up with the unexpected circumstances thatpresented themselves. It was impressive and I’m proud of the way our collective team came together toovercome unprecedented challenges for our customers, communities, and business. But, we don’t think it’s thebest long-term approach. We’ve become convinced that collaborating and inventing is easier and moreeffective when we’re working together and learning from one another in person. The energy and riffing onone another’s ideas happen more freely, and many of the best Amazon inventions have had their breakthroughmoments from people staying behind after a meeting and working through ideas on a whiteboard, orcontinuing the conversation on the walk back from a meeting, or just popping by a teammate’s office laterthat day with another thought. Invention is often messy. It wanders and meanders and marinates.Serendipitous interactions help it, and there are more of those in-person than virtually. It’s also significantlyeasier to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture when we’re in the office together most of thetime and surrounded by our colleagues. Innovation and our unique culture have been incredibly importantin our first 29 years as a company, and I expect it will be comparably so in the next 29.\\nA critical challenge we’ve continued to tackle is the rising cost to serve in our Stores fulfillment network (i.e.\\nthe cost to get a product from Amazon to a customer)—and we’ve made several changes that we believe will\\nmeaningfully improve our fulfillment costs and speed of delivery .\\nDuring the early part of the pandemic, with many physical stores shut down, our consumer business grew\\nat an extraordinary clip, with annual revenue increasing from $245B in 2019 to $434B in 2022. This meant thatwe had to double the fulfillment center footprint that we’d built over the prior 25 years and substantiallyaccelerate building a last-mile transportation network that’s now the size of UPS (along with a new sortationcenter network to assist with efficiency and speed when items needed to traverse long distances)—all in thespan of about two years. This was no easy feat, and hundreds of thousands of Amazonians worked very hardto make this happen. However, not surprisingly, with that rate and scale of change, there was a lot ofoptimization needed to yield the intended productivity. Over the last several months, we’ve scrutinized everyprocess path in our fulfillment centers and transportation network and redesigned scores of processes andmechanisms, resulting in steady productivity gains and cost reductions over the last few quarters. There’smore work to do, but we’re pleased with our trajectory and the meaningful upside in front of us.\\nWe also took this occasion to make larger structural changes that set us up better to deliver lower costs and\\nfaster speed for many years to come. A good example was reevaluating how our US fulfillment network wasorganized. Until recently, Amazon operated one national US fulfillment network that distributed inventoryfrom fulfillment centers spread across the entire country. If a local fulfillment center didn’t have the product acustomer ordered, we’d end up shipping it from other parts of the country, costing us more and increasingdelivery times. This challenge became more pronounced as our fulfillment network expanded to hundreds ofadditional nodes over the last few years, distributing inventory across more locations and increasing the\\ncomplexity of connecting the fulfillment center and delivery station nodes efficiently. Last year, we startedrearchitecting our inventory placement strategy and leveraging our larger fulfillment center footprint to movefrom a national fulfillment network to a regionalized network model. We made significant internal changes(e.g. placement and logistics software, processes, physical operations) to create eight interconnected regions insmaller geographic areas. Each of these regions has broad, relevant selection to operate in a largely self-sufficient way, while still being able to ship nationally when necessary. Some of the most meaningful and hard', metadata={'year': 2022, 'source': 'AMZN-2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf'}), Document(page_content='work came from optimizing the connections between this large amount of infrastructure. We also continue\\nto improve our advanced machine learning algorithms to better predict what customers in various parts of thecountry will need so that we have the right inventory in the right regions at the right time. We’ve recentlycompleted this regional roll out and like the early results. Shorter travel distances mean lower cost to serve,less impact on the environment, and customers getting their orders faster. On the latter, we’re excited aboutseeing more next day and same-day deliveries, and we’re on track to have our fastest Prime delivery speedsever in 2023. Overall, we remain confident about our plans to lower costs, reduce delivery times, and build a\\nmeaningfully larger retail business with healthy operating margins.\\nAWS has an $85B annualized revenue run rate, is still early in its adoption curve, but at a juncture where it’s\\ncritical to stay focused on what matters most to customers over the long-haul . Despite growing 29% year-over-\\nyear (“Y oY”) in 2022 on a $62B revenue base, AWS faces short-term headwinds right now as companiesare being more cautious in spending given the challenging, current macroeconomic conditions. While somecompanies might obsess over how they could extract as much money from customers as possible in these tighttimes, it’s neither what customers want nor best for customers in the long term, so we’re taking a differenttack. One of the many advantages of AWS and cloud computing is that when your business grows, you canseamlessly scale up; and conversely, if your business contracts, you can choose to give us back that capacityand cease paying for it. This elasticity is unique to the cloud, and doesn’t exist when you’ve already madeexpensive capital investments in your own on-premises datacenters, servers, and networking gear. In AWS,like all our businesses, we’re not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We’re trying to build customerrelationships (and a business) that outlast all of us; and as a result, our AWS sales and support teams arespending much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so they can better weather thisuncertain economy. Many of these AWS customers tell us that they’re not cost-cutting as much as cost-optimizing so they can take their resources and apply them to emerging and inventive new customerexperiences they’re planning. Customers have appreciated this customer-focused, long-term approach, andwe think it’ll bode well for both customers and AWS.\\nWhile these short-term headwinds soften our growth rate, we like a lot of the fundamentals that we’re seeing\\nin AWS. Our new customer pipeline is robust, as are our active migrations. Many companies usediscontinuous periods like this to step back and determine what they strategically want to change, and wefind an increasing number of enterprises opting out of managing their own infrastructure, and preferring tomove to AWS to enjoy the agility, innovation, cost-efficiency, and security benefits. And most importantlyfor customers, AWS continues to deliver new capabilities rapidly (over 3,300 new features and services launchedin 2022), and invest in long-term inventions that change what’s possible.\\nChip development is a good example. In last year’s letter, I mentioned the investment we were making in our\\ngeneral-purpose CPU processors named Graviton. Graviton2-based compute instances deliver up to 40%better price-performance than the comparable latest generation x86-based instances; and in 2022, we deliveredour Graviton3 chips, providing 25% better performance than the Graviton2 processors. Further, as machinelearning adoption has continued to accelerate, customers have yearned for lower-cost GPUs (the chipsmost commonly used for machine learning). AWS started investing years ago in these specialized chips formachine learning training and inference (inferences are the predictions or answers that a machine learningmodel provides). We delivered our first training chip in 2022 (“Trainium”); and for the most commonmachine learning models, Trainium-based instances are up to 140% faster than GPU-based instances at upto 70% lower cost. Most companies are still in the training stage, but as they develop models that graduate tolarge-scale production, they’ll find that most of the cost is in inference because models are trainedperiodically whereas inferences are happening all the time as their associated application is being exercised.We launched our first inference chips (“Inferentia”) in 2019, and they have saved companies like Amazon overa hundred million dollars in capital expense already. Our Inferentia2 chip, which just launched, offers upto four times higher throughput and ten times lower latency than our first Inferentia processor. With theenormous upcoming growth in machine learning, customers will be able to get a lot more done with AWS’straining and inference chips at a significantly lower cost. We’re not close to being done innovating here,and this long-term investment should prove fruitful for both customers and AWS. AWS is still in the earlystages of its evolution, and has a chance for unusual growth in the next decade.\\nSimilarly high potential, Amazon’s Advertising business is uniquely effective for brands, which is part of why it\\ncontinues to grow at a brisk clip . Akin to physical retailers’ advertising businesses selling shelf space, end-\\ncaps, and placement in their circulars, our sponsored products and brands offerings have been an integral part', metadata={'year': 2022, 'source': 'AMZN-2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf'}), Document(page_content='of the Amazon shopping experience for more than a decade. However, unlike physical retailers, Amazon\\ncan tailor these sponsored products to be relevant to what customers are searching for given what we knowabout shopping behaviors and our very deep investment in machine learning algorithms. This leads toadvertising that’s more useful for customers; and as a result, performs better for brands. This is part of whyour Advertising revenue has continued to grow rapidly (23% Y oY in Q4 2022, 25% Y oY overall for 2022on a $31B revenue base), even as most large advertising-focused businesses’ growth have slowed over the lastseveral quarters.\\nWe strive to be the best place for advertisers to build their brands. We have near and long-term opportunities\\nthat will help us achieve that mission. We’re continuing to make large investments in machine learning tokeep honing our advertising selection algorithms. For the past couple of years, we’ve invested in buildingcomprehensive, flexible, and durable planning and measurement solutions, giving marketers greater insightinto advertising effectiveness. An example is Amazon Marketing Cloud (“AMC”). AMC is a “clean room”(i.e. secure digital environment) in which advertisers can run custom audience and campaign analyticsacross a range of first and third-party inputs, in a privacy-safe manner, to generate advertising and businessinsights to inform their broader marketing and sales strategies. The Advertising and AWS teams havecollaborated to enable companies to store their data in AWS, operate securely in AMC with Amazon andother third-party data sources, perform analytics in AWS, and have the option to activate advertising onAmazon or third-party publishers through the Amazon Demand-Side Platform. Customers really like thisconcerted capability. We also see future opportunity to thoughtfully integrate advertising into our video,live sports, audio, and grocery products. We’ll continue to work hard to help brands uniquely engage withthe right audience, and grow this part of our business.\\nWhile it’s tempting in turbulent times only to focus on your existing large businesses, to build a sustainable,\\nlong-lasting, growing company that helps customers across a large number of dimensions, you can’t stop\\ninventing and working on long-term customer experiences that can meaningfully impact customers andyour company.\\nWhen we look at new investment opportunities, we ask ourselves a few questions:\\n◦If we were successful, could it be big and have a reasonable return on invested capital?\\n◦Is the opportunity being well-served today?\\n◦Do we have a differentiated approach?\\n◦And, do we have competence in that area? And if not, can we acquire it quickly?\\nIf we like the answers to those questions, then we’ll invest. This process has led to some expansions that\\nseem straightforward, and others that some folks might not have initially guessed.\\nThe earliest example is when we chose to expand from just selling Books , to adding categories like Music,\\nVideo, Electronics, and Toys. Back then (1998-1999), it wasn’t universally applauded, but in retrospect, itseems fairly obvious.\\nThe same could be said for our international Stores expansion . In 2022, our international consumer segment\\ndrove $118B of revenue. In our larger, established international consumer businesses, we’re big enough tobe impacted by the slowing macroeconomic conditions; however, the growth in 2019-2021 on a large base wasremarkable—30% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) in the UK, 26% in Germany, and 21% inJapan (excluding the impact of FX). Over the past several years, we’ve invested in new internationalgeographies, including India, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, various European countries, the Middle East, andparts of Africa. These new countries take a certain amount of fixed investment to get started and to scale, butwe like the trajectory they’re on, and their growth patterns resemble what we’ve seen in North Americaand our established international geographies. Emerging countries sometimes lack some of the infrastructureand services that our business relies on (e.g. payment methods, transportation services, and internet/telecom infrastructure). To solve these challenges, we continue to work with various partners to deliversolutions for customers. Ultimately, we believe that this investment in serving a broader geographical footprintwill allow us to help more customers across the world, as well as build a larger free cash flow-generatingconsumer business.', metadata={'year': 2022, 'source': 'AMZN-2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf'})]\n",

      "3 [Document(page_content='Dear shareholders:\\nOver the past 25 years at Amazon, I’ve had the opportunity to write many narratives, emails, letters, and\\nkeynotes for employees, customers, and partners. But, this is the first time I’ve had the honor of writing ourannual shareholder letter as CEO of Amazon. Jeff set the bar high on these letters, and I will try to keepthem worth reading.\\nWhen the pandemic started in early 2020, few people thought it would be as expansive or long-running as\\nit’s been. Whatever role Amazon played in the world up to that point became further magnified as mostphysical venues shut down for long periods of time and people spent their days at home. This meant thathundreds of millions of people relied on Amazon for PPE, food, clothing, and various other items thathelped them navigate this unprecedented time. Businesses and governments also had to shift, practicallyovernight, from working with colleagues and technology on-premises to working remotely. AWS played amajor role in enabling this business continuity. Whether companies saw extraordinary demand spikes, ordemand diminish quickly with reduced external consumption, the cloud’s elasticity to scale capacity up anddown quickly, as well as AWS’s unusually broad functionality helped millions of companies adjust to thesedifficult circumstances.\\nOur AWS and Consumer businesses have had different demand trajectories during the pandemic. In the\\nfirst year of the pandemic, AWS revenue continued to grow at a rapid clip—30% year over year (“Y oY”) in2020 on a $35 billion annual revenue base in 2019—but slower than the 37% Y oY growth in 2019. Thiswas due in part to the uncertainty and slowing demand that so many businesses encountered, but also inpart to our helping companies optimize their AWS footprint to save money. Concurrently, companies werestepping back and determining what they wanted to change coming out of the pandemic. Many concludedthat they didn’t want to continue managing their technology infrastructure themselves, and made thedecision to accelerate their move to the cloud. This shift by so many companies (along with the economyrecovering) helped re-accelerate AWS’s revenue growth to 37% Y oY in 2021.\\nConversely, our Consumer revenue grew dramatically in 2020. In 2020, Amazon’s North America and\\nInternational Consumer revenue grew 39% Y oY on the very large 2019 revenue base of $245 billion; and,this extraordinary growth extended into 2021 with revenue increasing 43% Y oY in Q1 2021. These areastounding numbers. We realized the equivalent of three years’ forecasted growth in about 15 months.\\nAs the world opened up again starting in late Q2 2021, and more people ventured out to eat, shop, and travel,\\nconsumer spending returned to being spread over many more entities. We weren’t sure what to expect in2021, but the fact that we continued to grow at double digit rates (with a two-year Consumer compoundedannual growth rate of 29%) was encouraging as customers appreciated the role Amazon played for themduring the pandemic, and started using Amazon for a larger amount of their household purchases.\\nThis growth also created short-term logistics and cost challenges. We spent Amazon’s first 25 years building\\na very large fulfillment network, and then had to double it in the last 24 months to meet customer demand.As we were bringing this new capacity online, the labor market tightened considerably, making it challengingboth to receive all of the inventory our vendors and sellers wanted to send us and to place that inventoryas close to customers as we typically do. Combined with ocean, air, and trucking capacity becoming scarcerand more expensive, this created extra transportation and productivity costs. Supply chains were disruptedin ways none of us had seen previously. We hoped that the major impact from COVID-19 would recede as2021 drew to a close, but then omicron reared its head in December, which had worldwide ramifications,including impacting people’s ability to work. And then in late February, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,fuel costs and inflation became bigger issues with which to contend.\\nSo, 2021 was a crazy and unpredictable year, continuing a trend from 2020. But, I’m proud of the incredible\\ncommitment and effort from our employees all over the world. I’m not sure any of us would have gotten', metadata={'year': 2021, 'source': 'AMZN-2021-Shareholder-Letter.pdf'}), Document(page_content='through the pandemic the same way without the dedication and extraordinary efforts shown by our teams\\nduring this period, and I’m eternally grateful.\\nIt’s not normal for a company of any size to be able to respond to something as discontinuous and\\nunpredictable as this pandemic turned out to be. What is it about Amazon that made it possible for us to doso? It’s because we weren’t starting from a standing start. We had been iterating on and remaking ourfulfillment capabilities for nearly two decades. In every business we pursue, we’re constantly experimentingand inventing. We’re divinely discontented with customer experiences, whether they’re our own or not. Webelieve these customer experiences can always be better, and we strive to make customers’ lives better andeasier every day. The beauty of this mission is that you never run out of runway; customers always want better,and our job is both to listen to their feedback and to imagine what else is possible and invent on theirbehalf.\\nPeople often assume that the game-changing inventions they admire just pop out of somebody’s head, a\\nlight bulb goes off, a team executes to that idea, and presto—you have a new invention that’s a breakawaysuccess for a long time. That’s rarely, if ever, how it happens. One of the lesser known facts about innovativecompanies like Amazon is that they are relentlessly debating, re-defining, tinkering, iterating, andexperimenting to take the seed of a big idea and make it into something that resonates with customers andmeaningfully changes their customer experience over a long period of time.\\nLet me give you some Amazon examples.Our Fulfillment Network : Going back to the pandemic, there’s no way we could have started working on\\nour fulfillment network in March 2020 and satisfied anything close to what our customers needed. We’d beeninnovating in our fulfillment network for 20 years, constantly trying to shorten the time to get items to\\ncustomers. In the early 2000s, it took us an average of 18 hours to get an item through our fulfillment centersand on the right truck for shipment. Now, it takes us two. To deliver as reliably and cost-effectively as wedesire, and to serve Amazon Prime members expecting shipments in a couple of days, we spent years buildingout an expansive set of fulfillment centers, a substantial logistics and transportation capability, andreconfigured how we did virtually everything in our facilities. For perspective, in 2004, we had sevenfulfillment centers in the U.S. and four in other parts of the world, and we hadn’t yet added delivery stations,which connect our fulfillment and sortation centers to the last-mile delivery vans you see driving aroundyour neighborhood. Fast forward to the end of 2021, we had 253 fulfillment centers, 110 sortation centers,and 467 delivery stations in North America, with an additional 157 fulfillment centers, 58 sortation centers,and 588 delivery stations across the globe. Our delivery network grew to more than 260,000 driversworldwide, and our Amazon Air cargo fleet has more than 100 aircraft. This has represented a capitalinvestment of over $100 billion and countless iterations and small process improvements by over a millionAmazonians in the last decade and a half.\\nIronically, just before COVID started, we’d made the decision to invest billions of incremental dollars over\\nseveral years to deliver an increasing number of Prime shipments in one day. This initiative was slowed by thechallenges of the pandemic, but we’ve since resumed our focus here. Delivering a substantial amount ofshipments in one day is hard (especially across the millions of items that we offer) and initially expensive aswe build out the infrastructure to scale this efficiently. But, we believe our over 200 million Prime customers,who will tell you very clearly that faster is almost always better, will love this. So, this capability to shipmillions of items within a couple days (and increasingly one day) was not from one aha moment and notdeveloped in a year or two. It’s been hard-earned by putting ourselves in the shoes of our customers, knowingwhat they wanted, organizing Amazonians to work together to invent better solutions, and investing alarge amount of financial and people resources over 20 years (often well in advance of when it would payout). This type of iterative innovation is never finished and has periodic peaks in investment years, but leadsto better long-term customer experiences, customer loyalty, and returns for our shareholders.\\nAWS : As we were defining AWS and working backwards on the services we thought customers wanted, we\\nkept triggering one of the biggest tensions in product development—where to draw the line on functionality inV1. One early meeting in particular—for our core compute service called Elastic Compute Cloud (“EC2”)—was scheduled for an hour, and took three, as we animatedly debated whether we could launch a computeservice without an accompanying persistent block storage companion (a form of network attached storage).', metadata={'year': 2021, 'source': 'AMZN-2021-Shareholder-Letter.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Everybody agreed that having a persistent block store was important to a complete compute service;\\nhowever, to have one ready would take an extra year. The question became could we offer customers auseful service where they could get meaningful value before we had all the features we thought they wanted?We decided that the initial launch of EC2 could be feature-poor if we also organized ourselves to listen tocustomers and iterate quickly. This approach works well if you indeed iterate quickly; but, is disastrous if youcan’t. We launched EC2 in 2006 with one instance size, in one data center, in one region of the world, withLinux operating system instances only (no Windows), without monitoring, load balancing, auto-scaling, oryes, persistent storage. EC2 was an initial success, but nowhere near the multi-billion-dollar service it’sbecome until we added the missing capabilities listed above, and then some.\\nIn the early days of AWS, people sometimes asked us why compute wouldn’t just be an undifferentiated\\ncommodity. But, there’s a lot more to compute than just a server. Customers want various flavors of compute(e.g. server configurations optimized for storage, memory, high-performance compute, graphics rendering,machine learning), multiple form factors (e.g. fixed instance sizes, portable containers, serverless functions),various sizes and optimizations of persistent storage, and a slew of networking capabilities. Then, there’sthe CPU chip that runs in your compute. For many years, the industry had used Intel or AMD x86 processors.We have important partnerships with these companies, but realized that if we wanted to push price andperformance further (as customers requested), we’d have to develop our own chips, too. Our first generalizedchip was Graviton, which we announced in 2018. This helped a subset of customer workloads run morecost-effectively than prior options. But, it wasn’t until 2020, after taking the learnings from Graviton and\\ninnovating on a new chip, that we had something remarkable with our Graviton2 chip, which provides up to40% better price-performance than the comparable latest generation x86 processors. Think about howmuch of an impact 40% improvement on compute is. Compute is used for every bit of technology. That’s ahuge deal for customers. And, while Graviton2 has been a significant success thus far (48 of the top 50 AWSEC2 customers have already adopted it), the AWS Chips team was already learning from what customerssaid could be better, and announced Graviton3 this past December (offering a 25% improvement on top ofGraviton2’s relative gains). The list of what we’ve invented and delivered for customers in EC2 (and AWS ingeneral) is pretty mind-boggling, and this iterative approach to innovation has not only given customersmuch more functionality in AWS than they can find anywhere else (which is a significant differentiator), butalso allowed us to arrive at the much more game-changing offering that AWS is today.\\nDevices : Our first foray into devices was the Kindle, released in 2007. It was not the most sophisticated\\nindustrial design (it was creamy white in color and the corners were uncomfortable for some people to hold),but revolutionary because it offered customers the ability to download any of over 90,000 books (nowmillions) in 60 seconds—and we got better and faster at building attractive designs. Shortly thereafter, welaunched a tablet, and then a phone (with the distinguishing feature of having front-facing cameras and agyroscope to give customers a dynamic perspective along with varied 3D experiences). The phone wasunsuccessful, and though we determined we were probably too late to this party and directed these resourceselsewhere, we hired some fantastic long-term builders and learned valuable lessons from this failure thathave served us well in devices like Echo and FireTV .\\nWhen I think of the first Echo device—and what Alexa could do for customers at that point—it was\\nnoteworthy, yet so much less capable than what’s possible today. Today, there are hundreds of millions ofAlexa-enabled devices out there (in homes, offices, cars, hotel rooms, Amazon Echo devices, and third-partymanufacturer devices); you can listen to music—or watch videos now; you can control your lights andhome automation; you can create routines like “Start My Day” where Alexa tells you the weather, yourestimated commute time based on current traffic, then plays the news; you can easily order retail items onAmazon; you can get general or customized news, updates on sporting events and related stats—and we’re stillquite early with respect to what Alexa and Alexa-related devices will do for customers. Our goal is forAlexa to be the world’s most helpful and resourceful personal assistant, who makes people’s lives meaningfullyeasier and better. We have a lot more inventing and iterating to go, but customers continue to indicate thatwe’re on the right path. We have several other devices at varying stages of evolution (e.g. Ring and Blinkprovide the leading digital home security solutions, Astro is a brand new home robot that we just launchedin late 2021), but it’s safe to say that every one of our devices, whether you’re talking about Kindle, FireTV,Alexa/Echo, Ring, Blink, or Astro is an invention-in-process with a lot more coming that will keepimproving customers’ lives.', metadata={'year': 2021, 'source': 'AMZN-2021-Shareholder-Letter.pdf'})]\n",

They estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were\\nbetween $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I’ll go with $25 billion.\\nFor customers, we have to break it down into consumer customers and AWS customers.\\nWe’ll do consumers first. We offer low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery, but imagine we ignore all of\\nthat for the purpose of this estimate and value only one thing: we save customers time.\\nCustomers complete 28% of purchases on Amazon in three minutes or less, and half of all purchases are\\nfinished in less than 15 minutes. Compare that to the typical shopping trip to a physical store – driving,\\nparking, searching store aisles, waiting in the checkout line, finding your car, and driving home. Research\\nsuggests the typical physical store trip takes about an hour. If you assume that a typical Amazon purchase\\ntakes 15 minutes and that it saves you a couple of trips to a physical store a week, that’s more than 75\\nhours a year saved. That’s important. We’re all busy in the early 21stcentury.\\nSo that we can get a dollar figure, let’s value the time savings at $10 per hour, which is conservative. Seventy-\\nfive hours multiplied by $10 an hour and subtracting the cost of Prime gives you value creation for each\\nPrime member of about $630. We have 200 million Prime members, for a total in 2020 of $126 billion of value\\ncreation.\\nAWS is challenging to estimate because each customer’s workload is so different, but we’ll do it anyway,\\nacknowledging up front that the error bars are high. Direct cost improvements from operating in the cloud\\nversus on premises vary, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. Across AWS’s entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion,\\nthat 30% would imply customer value creation of $19 billion (what would have cost them $64 billion on\\ntheir own cost $45 billion from AWS). The difficult part of this estimation exercise is that the direct cost\\nreduction is the smallest portion of the customer benefit of moving to the cloud. The bigger benefit is the\\nincreased speed of software development – something that can significantly improve the customer’s\\ncompetitiveness and top line. We have no reasonable way of estimating that portion of customer value\\nexcept to say that it’s almost certainly larger than the direct cost savings. To be conservative here (and\\nremembering we’re really only trying to get ballpark estimates), I’ll say it’s the same and call AWS customer\\nvalue creation $38 billion in 2020.\\nAdding AWS and consumer together gives us total customer value creation in 2020 of $164 billion.', metadata={'year': 2020, 'source': 'AMZN-2020-Shareholder-Letter.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Summarizing:\\nShareholders $21B\\nEmployees $91B\\n3P Sellers $25B\\nCustomers $164B\\nTotal $301B\\nIf each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above\\nwould be the “bottom lines” from those income statements. These numbers are part of the reason why people\\nwork for us, why sellers sell through us, and why customers buy from us. We create value for them. And\\nthis value creation is not a zero-sum game. It is not just moving money from one pocket to another. Draw\\nthe box big around all of society, and you’ll find that invention is the root of all real value creation. And value\\ncreated is best thought of as a metric for innovation.\\nOf course, our relationship with these constituencies and the value we create isn’t exclusively dollars and\\ncents. Money doesn’t tell the whole story. Our relationship with shareholders, for example, is relatively simple.\\nThey invest and hold shares for a duration of their choosing. We provide direction to shareowners\\ninfrequently on matters such as annual meetings and the right process to vote their shares. And even then\\nthey can ignore those directions and just skip voting.\\nOur relationship with employees is a very different example. We have processes they follow and standards\\nthey meet. We require training and various certifications. Employees have to show up at appointed times. Our\\ninteractions with employees are many, and they’re fine-grained. It’s not just about the pay and the benefits.\\nIt’s about all the other detailed aspects of the relationship too.\\nDoes your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn’t. I think\\nwe need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct\\nrelationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for how we create value for\\nemployees – a vision for their success.\\nIf you read some of the news reports, you might think we have no care for employees. In those reports, our\\nemployees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate. They’re\\nsophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work. When we survey fulfillment\\ncenter employees, 94% say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work.\\nEmployees are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts to stretch, get water, use the rest room,\\nor talk to a manager, all without impacting their performance. These informal work breaks are in addition to\\nthe 30-minute lunch and 30-minute break built into their normal schedule.\\nWe don’t set unreasonable performance goals. We set achievable performance goals that take into account\\ntenure and actual employee performance data. Performance is evaluated over a long period of time as we\\nknow that a variety of things can impact performance in any given week, day, or hour. If employees are on\\ntrack to miss a performance target over a period of time, their manager talks with them and provides\\ncoaching.\\nCoaching is also extended to employees who are excelling and in line for increased responsibilities. In fact,\\n82% of coaching is positive, provided to employees who are meeting or exceeding expectations. We terminate\\nthe employment of less than 2.6% of employees due to their inability to perform their jobs (and that\\nnumber was even lower in 2020 because of operational impacts of COVID-19).\\nEarth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work\\nThe fact is, the large team of thousands of people who lead operations at Amazon have always cared deeply\\nfor our hourly employees, and we’re proud of the work environment we’ve created. We’re also proud of the\\nfact that Amazon is a company that does more than just create jobs for computer scientists and people with\\nadvanced degrees. We create jobs for people who never got that advantage.', metadata={'year': 2020, 'source': 'AMZN-2020-Shareholder-Letter.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Despite what we’ve accomplished, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for our employees’ success.\\nWe have always wanted to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company. We won’t change that. It’s what gotus here. But I am committing us to an addition. We are going to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’sSafest Place to Work.\\nIn my upcoming role as Executive Chair, I’m going to focus on new initiatives. I’m an inventor. It’s what I\\nenjoy the most and what I do best. It’s where I create the most value. I’m excited to work alongside the largeteam of passionate people we have in Ops and help invent in this arena of Earth’s Best Employer andEarth’s Safest Place to Work. On the details, we at Amazon are always flexible, but on matters of vision weare stubborn and relentless. We have never failed when we set our minds to something, and we’re not going tofail at this either.\\nWe dive deep into safety issues. For example, about 40% of work-related injuries at Amazon are related to\\nmusculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), things like sprains or strains that can be caused by repetitive motions.MSDs are common in the type of work that we do and are more likely to occur during an employee’s firstsix months. We need to invent solutions to reduce MSDs for new employees, many of whom might beworking in a physical role for the first time.\\nOne such program is WorkingWell – which we launched to 859,000 employees at 350 sites across North\\nAmerica and Europe in 2020 – where we coach small groups of employees on body mechanics, proactivewellness, and safety. In addition to reducing workplace injuries, these concepts have a positive impact onregular day-to-day activities outside work.\\nWe’re developing new automated staffing schedules that use sophisticated algorithms to rotate employees\\namong jobs that use different muscle-tendon groups to decrease repetitive motion and help protect employeesfrom MSD risks. This new technology is central to a job rotation program that we’re rolling out throughout2021.\\nOur increased attention to early MSD prevention is already achieving results. From 2019 to 2020, overall\\nMSDs decreased by 32%, and MSDs resulting in time away from work decreased by more than half.\\nWe employ 6,200 safety professionals at Amazon. They use the science of safety to solve complex problems\\nand establish new industry best practices. In 2021, we’ll invest more than $300 million into safety projects,including an initial $66 million to create technology that will help prevent collisions of forklifts and othertypes of industrial vehicles.\\nWhen we lead, others follow. Two and a half years ago, when we set a $15 minimum wage for our hourly\\nemployees, we did so because we wanted to lead on wages – not just run with the pack – and because webelieved it was the right thing to do. A recent paper by economists at the University of California-Berkeleyand Brandeis University analyzed the impact of our decision to raise our minimum starting pay to $15 perhour. Their assessment reflects what we’ve heard from employees, their families, and the communities theylive in.\\nOur increase in starting wage boosted local economies across the country by benefiting not only our own\\nemployees but also other workers in the same community. The study showed that our pay raise resulted in a4.7% increase in the average hourly wage among other employers in the same labor market.\\nAnd we’re not done leading. If we want to be Earth’s Best Employer, we shouldn’t settle for 94% of\\nemployees saying they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work. We have to aim for 100%.And we’ll do that by continuing to lead on wages, on benefits, on upskilling opportunities, and in otherways that we will figure out over time.\\nIf any shareowners are concerned that Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work might dilute\\nour focus on Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, let me set your mind at ease. Think of it this way.If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer ecommerce and AWS, and do both at the highest\\nlevel, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements.

      "2 [Document(page_content='To our shareowners:\\nOne thing we’ve learned from the COVID-19 crisis is how important Amazon has become to our customers. We\\nwant you to know we take this responsibility seriously, and we’re proud of the work our teams are doing to helpcustomers through this difficult time.\\nAmazonians are working around the clock to get necessary supplies delivered directly to the doorsteps of people\\nwho need them. The demand we are seeing for essential products has been and remains high. But unlike apredictable holiday surge, this spike occurred with little warning, creating major challenges for our suppliers anddelivery network. We quickly prioritized the stocking and delivery of essential household staples, medicalsupplies, and other critical products.\\nOur Whole Foods Market stores have remained open, providing fresh food and other vital goods for customers.\\nWe are taking steps to help those most vulnerable to the virus, setting aside the first hour of shopping at WholeFoods each day for seniors. We have temporarily closed Amazon Books, Amazon 4-star, and Amazon Pop Upstores because they don’t sell essential products, and we offered associates from those closed stores theopportunity to continue working in other parts of Amazon.\\nCrucially, while providing these essential services, we are focused on the safety of our employees and contractors\\naround the world—we are deeply grateful for their heroic work and are committed to their health and well-being.Consulting closely with medical experts and health authorities, we’ve made over 150 significant process changesin our operations network and Whole Foods Market stores to help teams stay healthy, and we conduct dailyaudits of the measures we’ve put into place. We’ve distributed face masks and implemented temperature checksat sites around the world to help protect employees and support staff. We regularly sanitize door handles,stairway handrails, lockers, elevator buttons, and touch screens, and disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer arestandard across our network.\\nWe’ve also introduced extensive social distancing measures to help protect our associates. We have eliminated\\nstand-up meetings during shifts, moved information sharing to bulletin boards, staggered break times, and spreadout chairs in breakrooms. While training new hires is challenging with new distancing requirements, we continueto ensure that every new employee gets six hours of safety training. We’ve shifted training protocols so we don’thave employees gathering in one spot, and we’ve adjusted our hiring processes to allow for social distancing.\\nA next step in protecting our employees might be regular testing of all Amazonians, including those showing no\\nsymptoms. Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help getthe economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity thanis currently available. If every person could be tested regularly, it would make a huge difference in how we fightthis virus. Those who test positive could be quarantined and cared for, and everyone who tests negative couldre-enter the economy with confidence.\\nWe’ve begun the work of building incremental testing capacity. A team of Amazonians—from research scientists\\nand program managers to procurement specialists and software engineers—moved from their normal day jobsonto a dedicated team to work on this initiative. We have begun assembling the equipment we need to build ourfirst lab and hope to start testing small numbers of our frontline employees soon. We are not sure how far we willget in the relevant timeframe, but we think it’s worth trying, and we stand ready to share anything we learn.', metadata={'year': 2019, 'source': 'AMZN-2019-Shareholder-Letter.pdf'}), Document(page_content='While we explore longer-term solutions, we are also committed to helping support employees now. We increased\\nour minimum wage through the end of April by $2 per hour in the U.S., $2 per hour in Canada, £2 per hour in theUK, and €2 per hour in many European countries. And we are paying associates double our regular rate for any\\novertime worked—a minimum of $34 an hour—an increase from time and a half. These wage increases will costmore than $500 million, just through the end of April, and likely more than that over time. While we recognizethis is expensive, we believe it’s the right thing to do under the circumstances. We also established the AmazonRelief Fund—with an initial $25 million in funding—to support our independent delivery service partners andtheir drivers, Amazon Flex participants, and temporary employees under financial distress.\\nIn March, we opened 100,000 new positions across our fulfillment and delivery network. Earlier this week, after\\nsuccessfully filling those roles, we announced we were creating another 75,000 jobs to respond to customerdemand. These new hires are helping customers who depend on us to meet their critical needs. We know thatmany people around the world have suffered financially as jobs are lost or furloughed. We are happy to havethem on our teams until things return to normal and either their former employer can bring them back or newjobs become available. We’ve welcomed Joe Duffy, who joined after losing his job as a mechanic at Newarkairport and learned about an opening from a friend who is an Amazon operations analyst. Dallas preschoolteacher Darby Griffin joined after her school closed on March 9\\nthand now helps manage new inventory. We’re\\nhappy to have Darby with us until she can return to the classroom.\\nAmazon is acting aggressively to protect our customers from bad actors looking to exploit the crisis. We’ve\\nremoved over half a million offers from our stores due to COVID-based price gouging, and we’ve suspendedmore than 6,000 selling accounts globally for violating our fair-pricing policies. Amazon turned over informationabout sellers we suspect engaged in price gouging of products related to COVID-19 to 42 state attorneys generaloffices. To accelerate our response to price-gouging incidents, we created a special communication channel forstate attorneys general to quickly and easily escalate consumer complaints to us.\\nAmazon Web Services is also playing an important role in this crisis. The ability for organizations to access\\nscalable, dependable, and highly secure computing power—whether for vital healthcare work, to help studentscontinue learning, or to keep unprecedented numbers of employees online and productive from home—is criticalin this situation. Hospital networks, pharmaceutical companies, and research labs are using AWS to care forpatients, explore treatments, and mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 in many other ways. Academic institutionsaround the world are transitioning from in-person to virtual classrooms and are running on AWS to help ensurecontinuity of learning. And governments are leveraging AWS as a secure platform to build out new capabilitiesin their efforts to end this pandemic.\\nWe are collaborating with the World Health Organization, supplying advanced cloud technologies and technical\\nexpertise to track the virus, understand the outbreak, and better contain its spread. WHO is leveraging our cloudto build large-scale data lakes, aggregate epidemiological country data, rapidly translate medical training videosinto different languages, and help global healthcare workers better treat patients. We are separately making apublic AWS COVID-19 data lake available as a centralized repository for up-to-date and curated informationrelated to the spread and characteristics of the virus and its associated illness so experts can access and analyzethe latest data in their battle against the disease.\\nWe also launched the AWS Diagnostic Development Initiative, a program to support customers working to bring\\nmore accurate diagnostic solutions to market for COVID-19. Better diagnostics help accelerate treatment andcontainment of this pandemic. We committed $20 million to accelerate this work and help our customers harnessthe cloud to tackle this challenge. While the program was established in response to COVID-19, we also arelooking toward the future, and we will fund diagnostic research projects that have the potential to blunt futureinfectious disease outbreaks.', metadata={'year': 2019, 'source': 'AMZN-2019-Shareholder-Letter.pdf'})]\n",
