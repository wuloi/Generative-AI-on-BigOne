    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational interfaces such as chatbots and virtual assistants can be used to enhance the user experience for your customers. Chatbots uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries. Chatbots can be used in a variety of applications, such as customer service, sales, and e-commerce, to provide quick and efficient responses to users. They can be accessed through various channels such as websites, social media platforms, and messaging apps.\n",

    "## Chatbot using Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "![Amazon Bedrock - Conversational Interface](./images/chatbot_bedrock.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chatbot (Basic)** - Zero Shot chatbot with a FM model\n",
    "2. **Chatbot using prompt** - template(Langchain) - Chatbot with some context provided in the prompt template\n",
    "3. **Chatbot with persona** - Chatbot with defined roles. i.e. Career Coach and Human interactions\n",
    "4. **Contextual-aware chatbot** - Passing in context through an external file by generating embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Langchain framework for building Chatbot with Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "In Conversational interfaces such as chatbots, it is highly important to remember previous interactions, both at a short term but also at a long term level.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides memory components in two forms. First, LangChain provides helper utilities for managing and manipulating previous chat messages. These are designed to be modular and useful regardless of how they are used. Secondly, LangChain provides easy ways to incorporate these utilities into chains.\n",
    "It allows us to easily define and interact with different types of abstractions, which make it easy to build powerful chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Chatbot with Context - Key Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "The first process in a building a contextual-aware chatbot is to **generate embeddings** for the context. Typically, you will have an ingestion process which will run through your embedding model and generate the embeddings which will be stored in a sort of a vector store. In this example we are using a Titan embeddings model for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Embeddings](./images/embeddings_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Second process is the user request orchestration , interaction,  invoking and returing the results.\n",

      "Here are some tips for growing tomatoes:\n",
      "1. Choose a sunny location: Tomatoes need at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day to grow properly. Choose a spot in your garden that receives full sun or partial shade.\n",
      "2. Prepare the soil: Tomatoes prefer well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. Add compost or aged manure to the soil before planting.\n",
      "3. Plant the seeds: Plant tomato seeds deep in the soil, about 1 inch deep. Space the seeds about 2-3 feet apart.\n",
      "4. Water the plants regularly: Tomatoes need consistent moisture to grow. Water the plants deeply and regularly, especially during dry periods.\n",
      "5. Fertilize the plants: Tomatoes require regular fertilization. Use a balanced fertilizer that is high in phosphorus and potassium. Apply the fertilizer according to the package instructions.\n",
      "6. Support the plants: Tomatoes are vining plants and they need support to grow properly. Use stakes or trellises to support the plants as they grow.\n",
      "7. Prune the plants: Prune the plants regularly to remove dead or diseased branches and to promote healthy growth.\n",
      "8. Protect the plants from pests and diseases: Tomatoes are susceptible to a variety of pests and diseases. Use organic pest control methods such as handpicking or companion planting to protect your plants.\n",
      "9. Harvest the tomatoes: Tomatoes are ripe when they are fully colored and slightly soft to the touch. Harvest the tomatoes regularly to encourage continued growth and to prevent the plants from becoming overloaded.\n",
