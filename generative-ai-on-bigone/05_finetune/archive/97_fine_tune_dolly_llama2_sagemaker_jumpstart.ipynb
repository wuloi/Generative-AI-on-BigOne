It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals. Smelting uses heat and a chemical- reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind. The reducing agent is commonly a fossil fuel source of carbon, such as coke—or, in earlier times, charcoal.The oxygen in the ore binds to carbon at high temperatures as the chemical potential energy of the bonds in carbon dioxide (CO2) is lower than the bonds in the ore.',\n",

       "      <td>Born and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the McLaren young driver programme in 1998 at the age of 13, becoming the youngest racing driver ever to be contracted by a Formula One team. This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren for six years from 2007 to 2012, making Hamilton the first ever black driver to race in the series. In his inaugural season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi Räikkönen by one point. The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion—making a crucial overtake at the last corner on the last lap of the last race of the season—to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history. After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013.\\n\\nChanges to the regulations for 2014 mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines saw the start of a highly successful period for Hamilton, during which he won six further drivers' titles. Consecutive titles came in 2014 and 2015 during an intense rivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg. Following Rosberg's retirement in 2016, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival in two championship battles, in which Hamilton twice overturned mid-season point deficits to claim consecutive titles again in 2017 and 2018. His third and fourth consecutive titles followed in 2019 and 2020 to equal Schumacher's record of seven drivers' titles. Hamilton achieved his 100th pole position and race win during the 2021 season.\\n\\nHamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, environmental and social activism, and exploits in music and fashion. He has also become a prominent advocate in support of activism to combat racism and push for increased diversity in motorsport. Hamilton was the highest-paid Formula One driver from 2013 to 2021, and was ranked as one of the world's highest-paid athletes by Forbes of twenty-tens decade and 2021. He was also listed in the 2020 issue of Time as one of the 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours. Hamilton was granted honorary Brazilian citizenship in 2022.</td>\n",

    "* **max_new_tokens:** Model generates text until the output length (excluding the input context length) reaches max_new_tokens. If specified, it must be a positive integer.\n",
    "* **temperature:** Controls the randomness in the output. Higher temperature results in output sequence with low-probability words and lower temperature results in output sequence with high-probability words. If `temperature` -> 0, it results in greedy decoding. If specified, it must be a positive float.\n",
    "* **top_p:** In each step of text generation, sample from the smallest possible set of words with cumulative probability `top_p`. If specified, it must be a float between 0 and 1.\n",

    "- If `max_new_tokens` is not defined, the model may generate up to the maximum total tokens allowed, which is 4K for these models. This may result in endpoint query timeout errors, so it is recommended to set `max_new_tokens` when possible. For 7B, 13B, and 70B models, we recommend to set `max_new_tokens` no greater than 1500, 1000, and 500 respectively, while keeping the total number of tokens less than 4K.\n",
