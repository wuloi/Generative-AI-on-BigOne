# Questions and Answers

_Q: What is the concept of human alignment in the context of reinforcement learning?_

A: Human alignment in reinforcement learning is the process of aligning the outputs of a model with human values and preferences, ensuring the model's outputs are helpful, honest, and harmless.

_Q: How does reinforcement learning contribute to Generative AI model fine-tuning?_

A: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a generative model by modifying its underlying weights to better align with human preferences, as expressed through a reward model.

_Q: How does human-in-the-loop influence model training?_

A: Human-in-the-loop influences model training by providing human feedback, where human annotators rank various completions for a given prompt, creating multiple rows of training data for each prompt.

_Q: What steps are involved in training a custom reward model?_

A: To train a custom reward model, the first step is to collect human feedback on what is helpful, honest, and harmless. This typically involves using a managed service like Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth to collect data from human annotators. 

_Q: What is the role of Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth in training reward models?_

A: Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth is used to collect data from human labelers, allowing them to rank completions for a given prompt, which is critical for training reward models.

_Q: How does the toxicity detector by Meta function as a reward model?_

A: The toxicity detector by Meta, based on RoBERTa, functions as a reward model by predicting the probability distribution across two classes—'not hate' or 'hate'—for a given text input.

_Q: How does the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm aid in RLHF?_

A: The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm aids in RLHF by updating the weights of the generative model based on the reward value returned from the reward model, optimizing the policy to generate completions aligned with human values.

_Q: How can reward hacking be mitigated in RLHF?_

A: Reward hacking in RLHF can be mitigated by using a copied model with frozen weights as a reference. The RLHF-tuned model's completions are compared with this reference model using KL divergence to quantify and control divergence.

_Q: What methods are used to evaluate RLHF fine-tuned models?_

A: RLHF fine-tuned models are evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative evaluation techniques, which involve comparing prompt completions before and after RLHF. Often, a toxicity detector is used to evaluate the model with a toxicity prompt-completion dataset like RealToxicityPrompts from the AllenAI Institute.
