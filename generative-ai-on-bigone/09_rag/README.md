# Questions and Answers

_Q: What limitations do large language models face in context-aware reasoning?_

A: Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in having accurate and current knowledge, leading to issues like hallucination and knowledge cutoff.

_Q: How does hallucination and knowledge cutoff impact model accuracy?_

A: Hallucination leads to the generation of incorrect or irrelevant information, while knowledge cutoff limits the model's understanding to information available up to a certain date, impacting the accuracy of responses.

_Q: What is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and how does it work?_

A: RAG is a framework that provides LLMs access to data they did not see during training. It overcomes knowledge limitations by allowing LLM-powered applications to use external data sources.

_Q: How do external sources of knowledge contribute to RAG?_

A: External sources of knowledge in RAG provide additional data not contained within the LLM's parametric memory, helping to mitigate issues like hallucination and knowledge cutoff.

_Q: What is the significance of document loading and chunking in RAG?_

A: Document loading and chunking are important in RAG for organizing and processing external data, making it accessible for the model to enhance its knowledge base and reasoning capabilities".

_Q: Can you explain the RAG workflow and its implementation?_

A: The RAG workflow involves integrating external data sources with LLMs, using processes like document loading, chunking, and retrieval-augmented methods to enhance the model's responses with additional, relevant information.

_Q: What are the key considerations in developing context-aware reasoning applications?_

A: Key considerations include managing the accuracy of knowledge, updating information regularly, and integrating external data sources effectively to address hallucination and knowledge cutoff issues.

_Q: How does embedding vector store and retrieval affect RAG's performance?_

A: Embedding vector storage and retrieval are crucial in RAG for efficiently managing and accessing relevant external data, which significantly enhances the model's performance by providing additional context and information.

_Q: What are some effective strategies for reranking with maximum marginal relevance?_

A: Effective strategies include using algorithms that prioritize relevance and diversity in the retrieval results, ensuring that the most pertinent and varied information is presented in response to queries.
