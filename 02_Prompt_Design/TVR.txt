Once there was a splendid Velveteen Rabbit, spotted brown and white with real thread whiskers. On Christmas morning, he was the best gift in the Boy's stocking but was soon forgotten in the rush of new presents.

**Christmas Morning**

Overlooked in the toy cupboard, the Rabbit felt insignificant among the mechanical toys and others that pretended to be real. Only the wise Skin Horse, old and balding, was kind, sharing the nursery magic's secret: becoming Real is about a child's enduring love.

"What is REAL?" the Rabbit asked, curious about the essence of being truly alive.

"Real isn't in how you're made," the Skin Horse replied. "It's what happens when you're loved over time. It may hurt, but you won't mind because you become Real."

**The Skin Horse Tells His Story**

The Skin Horse shared his own becoming Real story, made so by the Boy's Uncle. Once Real, one cannot become unreal; it's eternal.

As spring arrived, the Rabbit's fur grew shabby, but the Boy's love never waned. The Rabbit was content, even when his appearance faded, for he was Real to the Boy.

**Spring Time**

One summer, the Boy fell ill with scarlet fever. The Rabbit stayed hidden, fearing replacement. When the Boy recovered, it was decided all his old toys, including the Rabbit, must be burned to prevent infection.

**Anxious Times**

Left alone behind the fowl-house, the Rabbit felt lonely and sad. A tear fell, and a magical flower grew from the earth, from which the nursery magic Fairy emerged. She told the Rabbit he would become Real to everyone and transformed him into a real rabbit.

**The Fairy Flower**

The Fairy took the Rabbit to the woods, where the wild rabbits accepted him as one of their own. The Rabbit discovered he could now move like them, with newfound brown fur and agility.

**At Last! At Last!**

As seasons passed, the Boy visited the woods and saw two rabbits. One seemed strangely familiar, resembling his lost Bunny, but he didn't realize it was truly his transformed Velveteen Rabbit, returned to watch over him.

The story of the Velveteen Rabbit is a tale of love's transformative power, turning a humble toy into a Real friend, enduring beyond physical form.
